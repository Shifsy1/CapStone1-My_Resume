    <p>Reading books/novels is my passion. I love reading. 
       Books help me escape the real world for a while, forget about all the stress and problems.
       My favourite genres are Mystery, Thriller, drama, and romance. 
       Reading to me is like therapy. I love to read is an understatement.

    <p>I love cooking. Now some people that know me would be snickering and saying "Ha!" but it is true.
        I love cooking and feeding people. Sometime the final dish is not the best but I absolutely enjoy the process. One day will come where all my dishes wiould be 5 star!<br/>
        Fingers crossed!
